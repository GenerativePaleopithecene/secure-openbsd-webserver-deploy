### Set Up a Secure HTTPD Server on OpenBSD with a Single Script

This script automates the setup of a secure HTTP server on OpenBSD, a Unix-like operating system known for its emphasis on security and stability. While OpenBSD shares similarities with Linux, it has unique features and tools, making it a preferred choice for security-focused applications.

#### Key Features of the Script:
- **Web Server Setup**: Configures `httpd`, OpenBSD's native web server, with SSL support.
- **Security Enhancements**: Implements firewall rules, SSH hardening, user account limitations, and periodic security checks.
- **Automated Maintenance**: Sets up cron jobs for regular system updates and security audits using `lynis`, a popular security tool.
- **Malware Protection**: Installs and configures ClamAV for regular virus scans.
- **System Hardening**: Adjusts system settings for enhanced security and monitors file integrity.

#### Installation Pointers for Linux Users:
1. **Accessing OpenBSD**: You'll need access to an OpenBSD system. This could be a dedicated machine, a virtual machine, or a remote server.
2. **SSH Access**: Similar to Linux, you can SSH into your OpenBSD system. Ensure you have SSH access to your OpenBSD machine.
3. **Using the Shell**: OpenBSD's default shell is `ksh` (KornShell), which is similar to `bash` in Linux. Most Linux shell commands will work the same way.
4. **Package Management**: OpenBSD uses `pkg_add` for package installation, akin to `apt` or `yum` in Linux. The script automatically handles package installations and updates.
5. **File Editing**: Use a text editor like `vi`, `nano`, or `emacs` to create and edit the script file. These editors are common across Linux and BSD systems.
6. **Executing the Script**: After creating the script file, make it executable with `chmod +x <script_name>.sh` and run it with `./<script_name>.sh`.

#### Before You Begin:
- **Read the Script**: Go through the script to understand what each part does. Modify the variables at the top of the script to suit your setup (like `DOMAIN`, `USERNAME`, and `PASSWORD`).
- **Backup Important Data**: Always back up important data before running system-level scripts, especially if you are new to OpenBSD.
- **Test in a Safe Environment**: If possible, test the script in a non-production environment first, such as a virtual machine.
